\section{Observations}
A single bulb can have a effect on the solution of max $O(nr)$ where $r$ is the radius of the bulb and $n$ is the number of points inside. 

%If we target the wrong initial inner TSP point we incur a max penalty of $4r$ the same goes for a poorly chosen exit point. Thus so long as we accurately solve the inner the rest of the way we incur a penalty of at most $8r$.

\section{Definitions}
\begin{defn}
    A \textbf{Pair Decomposition} is a of $P$ is a set of pairs
    $$\PairDecomp = \left\{ \{A_1, B_1\}, \ldots, \{A_k,B_k\} \right\}$$
    such that (I) $\forall i; A_i,B_i \subset P$, (II) $\forall i; A_i \cap B_i = \emptyset$, and (III) $\bigcup_{i=1}^k A_i \otimes B_i = \binom{P}{2} = P \otimes P$.
\end{defn}

\begin{defn}
    $\dist(Q,R) = \min_{q \in Q, r \in R} |qr|$
\end{defn}

\begin{defn}
    The pair $\{Q,R\}$ is \textbf{$s$-well-separated} if
    $$\max\{\diam(Q), \diam(R)\} \leq \frac{1}{s} \cdot \dist(Q,R)$$
\end{defn}

\begin{defn}
    Let $P = A \cup B$ (with $A \cap B = \emptyset$). We say that $A$ and $B$ are \textbf{TSP-Separated} if the \emph{any} optimal TSP tour on $P$ visits all points in $A$ before any point in $B$ (or vice versa).
\end{defn}

\section{Some Proved Ideas}
\begin{thm}
Let $A$ and $B$ be two finite sets of points that are s-well-separated, let $p,p' \in A$, and let $q,q' \in B$. 
Then the following inequalities hold:
\begin{align*}
    |pq| &\leq (1 + 2/s) \cdot |pq'| \\
    |pq| &\leq (1 + 4/s) \cdot |p'q'| \\
    |pp'| &\leq (2/s) \cdot |pq| \\
\end{align*}
\end{thm}

\begin{thm}
Within a ball of diameter $d$ within a metric space the difference in shortest hamiltonian paths between any two points is at most $2d$.
\end{thm}
\begin{proof}
    Fix one pair of endpoints $(a,b)$ and let $P_{a,b}$ be the optimal Hamiltonian path from $a$ to $b$ with length denoted $L(a,b)$.
    Next consider another pair of endpoints $(c,d)$ we can then build a hamiltonian path from $c$ to $d$ using $P_{a,b}$.
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Start at $c$
        \item Travel from $c$ to $a$ for a cost of $\dist(c,a) \leq d$
        \item Follow the path $P_{a,b}$ from $a$ to $b$ for a cost of $c \leq L(a,b)$. (shortcutting $c,d$)
        \item Travel from $b$ to $d$ for a cost of $\dist(b,d) \leq d$
    \end{enumerate}
    %WLOG assume that $c$ occurs before $d$ on the path $P_{a,b}$. 
    %Then let $x$ be the point which precedes $c$ on the path and let $x'$ be the point that immediately follows. 
    %In the same way define $y$ and $y'$ for point $d$.
    %Since the triangle inequality must be obeyed we know 
    Since the space obeys the triangle inequality we know that during step 3 we can only decrease the cost by shortcutting. Thus the total cost of this path is at most $L(a,b) + 2d$. Furthermore we know that this cost must ceil whatever the optimal hamiltonian path from $c$ to $d$ is. Thus we have shown that $L(c,d) \leq L(a,b) + 2d$. By symmetry of the argument we can also show that $L(a,b) \leq L(c,d) + 2d$. Combining these two inequalities we have that $\forall a,b,c,d;|L(a,b) - L(c,d)| \leq 2d$ as desired. 
\end{proof}

\begin{thm}
Let $A$ and $B$ be two finite sets of points that are TSP-separated. 
Let $|A| = n$ and $|B| = m$.
Let $P_a = [(a_1,a_2), \dots, (a_{n-1}, a_n)]$ represent the hamiltonian path through $A$ derived as a subpath of the optimal TSP tour on $A \cup B$ and let $P_b$ be defined similarly.
Then $\forall (a_i, a_{i+1}) \in P_a, (b_j, b_{j+1}) \in P_b$ it holds that
$|a_i a_{i+1}| + |b_j b_{j+1}| \leq \min(|a_i b_j| + |a_{i+1} b_{j+1}|, |a_i b_{j+1}| + |a_{i+1} b_{j}|)$.
\end{thm}

\appendix
\section{Outdated proofs}
% this section is for if a better bound is found (ie proof is still valid but not as strong as desired)

\section{Dead ends}
% these theorems are false

Let $A$ and $B$ be two finite sets of points that are TSP-separated. 
Let $\Cover_k(S)$ denote the optimal cost of $k$ disjoint hamiltonian paths covering all points in set $S$.
Let $\BigLength_{2k}(A,B)$ be the sum of the $2k$ shortest edges between $A$ and $B$ without point replacement.
Then, $\Cover_1(A) + \Cover_1(B) + \BigLength_{2}(A,B) \leq \Cover_k(A) + \Cover_k(B) + \BigLength_{2k}(A,B)$.

Let $A$ and $B$ be two finite sets of points that are TSP-separated. Then $\dist(A,B) \geq \max(\lambda(A), \lambda(B))$.
[Where $\lambda(A) = \max(|a_1 a_2|, |a_2 a_3|, \dots, |a_{n-1} a_n|)$ so that it represents the longest edge in the hamiltonian path through $A$ which is derived as a subpath of the optimal TSP tour on $A \cup B$. The same definition applies to $\lambda(B)$.]

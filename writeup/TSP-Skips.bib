  abstract = {Prize-Collecting TSP is a variant of the traveling salesperson problem where one may drop vertices from the tour at the cost of vertex-dependent penalties. The quality of a solution is then measured by adding the length of the tour and the sum of all penalties of vertices that are not visited. We present a polynomial-time approximation algorithm with an approximation guarantee slightly below \$1.6\$, where the guarantee is with respect to the natural linear programming relaxation of the problem. This improves upon the previous best-known approximation ratio of \$1.774\$. Our approach is based on a known decomposition for solutions of this linear relaxation into rooted trees. Our algorithm takes a tree from this decomposition and then performs a pruning step before doing parity correction on the remainder. Using a simple analysis, we bound the approximation guarantee of the proposed algorithm by \$(1+\textbackslash sqrt\{5\})/2 \textbackslash approx 1.618\$, the golden ratio. With some additional technical care we further improve it to \$1.599\$. Furthermore, we show that for the path version of Prize-Collecting TSP (known as Prize-Collecting Stroll) our approach yields an approximation guarantee of 1.6662, improving upon the previous best-known guarantee of 1.926.},

We present an algorithm that achieves an approximation guarantee of \$1.774\$ with respect to the natural linear programming relaxation of the problem.

A TSP instance is rectilinear when the points lie in the plane and the distance considered between two points is the \$l\_1\$ distance. In this paper, a fixed-parameter algorithm for the Rectilinear TSP is presented and relies on techniques for solving TSP on bounded-treewidth graphs. It proves that the problem can be solved in \$O\textbackslash left(nh7\textasciicircum h\textbackslash right)\$ where \$h \textbackslash leq n\$ denotes the number of horizontal lines containing the points of \$P\$. The same technique can be directly applied to the problem of finding a shortest rectilinear Steiner tree that interconnects the points of \$P\$ providing a \$O\textbackslash left(nh5\textasciicircum h\textbackslash right)\$ time complexity. Both bounds improve over the best time bounds known for these problems.},

First, we show that a simple modification yields the optimal solution in O(n4) time using O(n2) space. To reduce the running times we consider several approximation algorithms. Our main result is a (2+ε)-approximation algorithm with running time O(nm+n2(log n+1/ε3d)) using O(n2) space.},

The new construction is arguably simpler and more elegant. We point out that using WSPD, one can approximate, in near-linear time, the distortion of a bijection between two point sets in low dimensions. As a new application of WSPD, we show how to shortcut a polygonal curve such that its dilation is below a prespecified quantity. In particular, we show a near-linear time algorithm for computing a simple subcurve for a given polygonal curve in the plane so that the new subcurve has no self-intersection.},

  abstract = {The travelling salesman problem (TSP) is one of combinatorial optimization problems of huge importance to practical applications. However, the TSP in its “pure” form may lack some essential issues for a decision maker—e.g., time-dependent travelling conditions. Among those shortcomings, there is also a lack of possibility of not visiting some nodes in the network—e.g., thanks to the existence of some more cost-efficient means of transportation. In this article, an extension of the TSP in which some nodes can be skipped at the cost of penalties for skipping those nodes is presented under a new name and in a new mathematical formulation. Such an extension can be applied as a model for transportation cost reduction due to the possibility of outsourcing deliveries to some nodes in a TSP route. An integer linear programming formulation of such a problem based on the Gavish–Graves-flow-based TSP formulation is introduced. This formulation makes it possible to solve the considered problem by using any integer linear programming optimization software. Numerical examples and opportunities for further research are presented.},

  abstract = {This paper introduces a computational method for generating metric Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP) instances having a large integrality gap. The method is based on the solution of an integer programming problem, called IH-OPT, that takes as input a fractional solution of the Subtour Elimination Problem (SEP) on a TSP instance and computes a TSP instance having an integrality gap larger than or equal to the integrality gap of the first instance. The decision variables of IH-OPT are the entries of the TSP cost matrix, and the constraints are defined by the intersection of the metric cone with an exponential number of inequalities, one for each possible TSP tour. Given the very large number of constraints, we have implemented a branch-and-cut algorithm for solving IH-OPT. Then, by sampling cost vectors over the metric polytope and by solving the corresponding SEP, we can generate random fractional vertices of the SEP polytope. If we solve the IH-OPT problem for every sampled vertex using our branch-and-cut algorithm, we can select the generated TSP instance (i.e., cost vector), yielding the longest runtime for Concorde, the state-of-the-art TSP solver. Our computational results show that our method is very effective in producing challenging instances. As a by-product, we release the Hard-TSPLIB, a library of 41 small metric TSP instances which have a large integrality gap and are challenging in terms of runtime for Concorde.},
